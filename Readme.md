Search through a list of names to find the person/monster you're looking for. A rolodex is like an address book but it sits on your desk and you can flip through the different contact cards you wrote.

# Things I learned
- Making yourself a folder called components is good practice
  - In this folder make a new folder for each component you make and inside that
    - Then add in your jsx file and call it    featurename.component.jsx
    - and add your feature's css in that folder too like  featurename.styles.css
- create-react-app takes a second when you first create it. Take a swig of coffee while you wait.
- yarn.lock and package-lock.json exist so that you can't mess up which dependencies you're using with other people who use your code.
- I got a taste of how to pass state and props between components
- Deconstructing is your friend
  - for example:  const { monsters, searchField } = this.state;
- How to handle click events with react
- I remembered some array tricks like .filter and .map and .includes
- I'll be writing "yarn start" a lot in the future I imagine.

I'm getting a sense of how organized code can be now and coding with components in mind just seems like less spaghetti in my brain. I'm liking this React thing so far.
