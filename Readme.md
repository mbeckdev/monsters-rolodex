Search through a list of names to find the person/monster you're looking for. A rolodex is like an address book but it sits on your desk and you can flip through the different contact cards you wrote.

# Things I learned
- Making yourself a folder called components is good practice
  - In this folder make a new folder for each component you make and inside that
    - Then add in your jsx file and call it    featurename.component.jsx
    - and add your feature's css in that folder too like  featurename.styles.css
- create-react-app takes a second when you first create it. Take a swig of coffee while you wait.
- yarn.lock and package-lock.json exist so that you can't mess up which dependencies you're using with other people who use your code.
- I got a taste of how to pass state and props between components
- Deconstructing is your friend
  - for example:  const { monsters, searchField } = this.state;
- How to handle click events with react
- I remembered some array tricks like .filter and .map and .includes
- I'll be writing "yarn start" a lot in the future I imagine.

I'm getting a sense of how organized code can be now and coding with components in mind just seems like less spaghetti in my brain. I'm liking this react thing so far.

# Other stuff
The rest of this readme was created through create-react-app. I think I'll leave it so I can check out these resources later.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
